## Reverse Engineering Practice
This is a repo of binaries to reverse engineer usign ghidra or whatever dissassembler you prefer. I have also included the original C++ programs to compare. I primarily focus on basic looping and array structures. 
- The binaries and theor source code are included in pairs. 
-- Ex. array and array.cpp
